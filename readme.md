"server-rootup" is the server for the "rootup" repository.

This server runs best on localhost:8080.

The app uses Express and Node and is built in react.

There are no keys required to use the app. 

Dummy farm profiles are saved in farmData.json and corresponding images are stored as static assets in the public / assets / images folder on the server. Both are extracted by an axios call on the front end. 

User data is not currently being used but will be added to future versions of the app.
